## Release details üîç

### Podman v5.5

Podman Desktop aims to work offline, so it ship alongside its binary, the podman executable.
Including in this release, the new version of Podman 5.5 will be included, providing new features, bug fixes and a better stability while using the tool.

You can found the full changelog of Podman 5.5 on their release page [containers/podman/releases#v5.5.0](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.5.0)

:::info

While the podman binary is updated in this update, the existing Podman Machines will still stay in the version where have been created.

To update your podman machine(s) you need to remove them and init a new one.

:::

### Bootc Extension ü¶≠

The Podman Desktop Boot container extension (Aka Bootc) has seen recently some big improvement, one of them is the usage of [macadam](https://github.com/crc-org/macadam).

> Macadam is a cross-platform command-line tool to create and manage virtual machines. It runs on Windows, macOS and linux, and uses each OS native virtualization stacks, that is WSL2 on Windows, Apple‚Äôs Virtualization Framework on macOS and QEMU on linux. macadam is reusing podman-machine code.

As the bootc tool applies a container image as an update on an already running Linux system,
allowing the output to boot an entire OS with the container image included, to test it you either need a dedicated machine or create a
a virtual machine from the artifact.

To simplify the developer experience of testing the artifact,
the Podman Desktop Bootc extension offers you a way to directly create a virtual machine from the artifact you created.

<br/>

:::note

They are known issue with the virtualization that could found on the [bootc extension readme](https://github.com/podman-desktop/extension-bootc?tab=readme-ov-file#known-issues).

:::

Another important aspect when presenting a new technology is showcasing capabilities, thanks to [Charlie Drage](https://github.com/cdrage) and [Tim deBoer](https://github.com/deboer-tim)
a lot of efforts have been put into demonstrating bootable container, such as Kernel module management, WiFi modules, systemd unit files etc.

You can found ready to use examples in `Bootable Containers > Examples`.

### AI Lab ‚ú®

The Podman Desktop AI Lab extension started as an experiment in 2024, exploring how AI workflows could be containerized,
celebrating more than one year of updates and progress, the extension has grown to support wide range of tools,
such as Instructlab[^64], llamaCPP[^65], WhisperCPP[^69] and with the latest release OpenVINO, llama-stack and MCP.

#### OpenVINO

With the introduction of OpenVINO[^67] as supported inference runtime, we are now able to run locally through Podman OpenVINO models[^68]

<ThemedImage
alt="AI Lab OpenVINO inference provider"
sources={{
    light: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.19/extension-ai-lab-openvino-light.png').default,
    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.19/extension-ai-lab-openvino-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>
<br/>

#### llama-stack

Llama Stack standardizes the core building blocks that simplify AI application development[^71].

With the latest version of AI lab, we introduce support for llama-stack, running in a containerized environment,
inference servers running inside AI lab will be registered to the llama-server, to be used from their client.

<ThemedImage

sources={{
    light: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.19/extension-ai-lab-llama-stack-light.png').default,
    dark: require('./img/podman-desktop-release-1.19/extension-ai-lab-llama-stack-dark.png').default,
  }}
/>
<br/>

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Creating a product from LLMs has proven to be challenging, and emerging protocols try to help such as MCP.

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.[^70]

The first steps to support MCP in the AI Lab playground have started, allowing developers to experiment directly through the GUI before trying to integrate it to their application.

### Minc extension üì¶

[MicroShift](https://github.com/openshift/microshift) is a project that optimizes OpenShift Kubernetes for small form factor and edge computing[^66].
Similar to [kind](/docs/kind) and [minikube](/docs/minikube) an extension for creating and managing Microshift cluster locally through Podman has been created.

You can learn more about it in the [Microshift](/docs/openshift/microshift) section.

Interested in Bootable container and Microshift? [Charlie Drage](https://github.com/cdrage) wrote recently a blog [Creating a MicroShift bootable image with Podman Desktop](/blog/2024/11/08/bootc-microshift)

:::

### RHEL lightspeed ‚ö°

Red Hat Lightspeed is a generative AI assistant integrated into Red Hat's hybrid cloud platforms, such as OpenShift and Enterprise Linux.[^100]
It provides natural language guidance within the console to simplify complex tasks, enhance productivity, and bridge IT skills gaps.

[^100]: [Red Hat Announces General Availability of Red Hat OpenShift Lightspeed to Supercharge Hybrid Cloud Productivity with Generative AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-announces-general-availability-red-hat-openshift-lightspeed-supercharge-hybrid-cloud-productivity-generative-ai)

Users can choose from various AI models, including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, WatsonX, or deploy private models on Red Hat platforms.

With a RedHat subscription, you can experiment with Red Hat Lightspeed from anywhere, including Podman Desktop, through a new extension called RHEL Lightspeed.

You can install it directly from Podman Desktop in `Extensions > Catalog > RHEL Lightspeed`.

As this new extension just landed in the Podman Desktop extension catalog, you may share your feedback on the extension repository [redhat-developer/podman-desktop-redhat-lightspeed-ext](https://github.com/redhat-developer/podman-desktop-redhat-lightspeed-ext).

:::

### RHEL VMs extension üóÉÔ∏è

Through the Podman executable, Podman Desktop manage Virtual Machines,
the cross-platform code responsible for that has been reuse to create the macadam tool, mention earlier.

The RHEL VMs extension helps the user run RHEL Virtual machines, using the macadam tool.
